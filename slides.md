# The Four Freedoms

Free and Open Source Software is any piece of software that respects their
  user‚Äôs four freedoms:
- **The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0)**

- **The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
    computing as you wish (freedom 1).** 

-  **Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to
    redistribute copies so you can help others
    (freedom 2).**

- **The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
    (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
    benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
    this.**

# Git

A Short History of Git

- The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope.
- In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.
- In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the company that developed BitKeeper broke down. 
- This prompted the Linux development community to develop their own tool

Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:

- Speed
- Scalability
- Simple Design
- Fully distributed
- Being free and open source
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
