# What is FOSS?
### FOSS = Free and Open Source Software
##### It‚Äôs built around the Four Freedoms:

<v-clicks>

-  üèÉ **Freedom 0** - Freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
-  üìñ **Freedom 1** - Freedom to study how the program works and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
- üß∞ **Freedom 2** - Freedom to redistribute the copies with others. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- üõ† **Freedom 3** - Freedom to share modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

</v-clicks>

##### The idea is that access to source code is essential for freedom and collaboration.

# Open Source Sofware

We are talking about Open Source Software but we need to know what is what
## Open Source vs Free Software

|                                                     |                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Free Software                 | focuses on users‚Äô freedom. |
| Open Source Software          | focuses on the way software is developed and distributed. |

Licenses can be protective (copyleft) or non-protective (permissive).
